              <span>A GLOBAL BRAND AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AGENCY</span>
    
              <p>In 2018, we united two accomplished marketing and communication companies — VML and Y&R — to deliver a contemporary, fully integrated offering on a global scale. In 2020, VMLY&R joined forces with Geometry to create VMLY&R COMMERCE, a new end-to-end “Creative Commerce Company" that operates as a distinct company within VMLY&R. Today, VMLY&R thrives on creating work that brings people together, united by the power of human connection. We harness creativity, technology, and culture to create connected brands that drive value for our clients and touch lives around the world.</p>
